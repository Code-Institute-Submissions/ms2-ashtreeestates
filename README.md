# MS2: Ash Tree Estates.

[View the live project here.](https://adamdelancey.github.io/ms2-ashtreeestates/)

As my submission for the Code Institute Milestone Project 2, this Ash Tree Estates website is based on a family student letting business
that is looking to expand its audience and get more views and enquiries from the student market, as well as book viewings and have access to useful documents for the tenancy.
It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential users.

# Accessibility

## Alt Tags

In order to ensure that all images are accessible for those using a screen reader, I have ensured that all images used throughout the site include alt tags.

## Forms

The forms on the site used in the modals of "Contact Us" and "Enquire Now" have aria-labels so that screen readers can read out what is the required input in the necessary fields.

# Technologies used

## Languages Used

-   HTML5

## Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

1. [Bootstrap 4.5.2:](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/)
    - Bootstrap was used to assist with the responsiveness and styling of the website, such as the navbar, carousels and cards features.
1. [Google Fonts:](https://fonts.google.com/)
    - Google fonts were used to import the 'Raleway' font which is used on all pages throughout the project.
1. [Font Awesome:](https://fontawesome.com/)
    - Font Awesome was used on all pages throughout the website to add icons for aesthetic and UX purposes. 
1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
    - Git was used for version control by utilising the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.
1. [GitHub:](https://github.com/)
    - GitHub is used to store the projects code after being pushed from Git.

# Testing

## Validation

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

-   [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) - [Results](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fadamdelancey.github.io%2Fms1-travelsweden%2F)
    <p> <img src="documentation/screenshots/html-validate.jpg">  </p> 
-   [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - [Results](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fadamdelancey.github.io%2Fms1-travelsweden%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en) -  there are 2 property issues found when checking the site. However, these are being validated from the Bootstrap CDN link and therefore out of my control.

## Lighthouse

<p ><img src="documentation/screenshots/lighthouse-scores.jpg">

From Chrome Developer Tools, this Lighthouse score is based on the homepage while being viewed on desktop. I worked hard on ensuring high scores across the site in particular by putting every image through [Tiny PNG](https://tinypng.com/), and improving SEO scores by adding a meta description to each page.

# Deployment

The site was published in GitPages using the folling steps:
1. First, all code was written on the IDE Gitpod and was then pushed to GitHub using the 'git push' entry in the terminal, where it is now stored in [my repository](https://github.com/adamdelancey/ms1-travelsweden).
2. To push the site live, under the Settings section of the repository I selected, I scrolled down to where it says 'GitHub Pages'.
3. I then selected 'Master Branch' under Source and then the page automatically refreshed.
4. This created the URL which can be viewed [here](https://adamdelancey.github.io/ms1-travelsweden/index.html).

To access the code, it can be run locally through a download or cloned.

Initially, I used "git commit" and "git push" for every major change, then at later stages used these functions when de-bugging or making minor editing changes to ensure the live version was the most recent version, as well as to avoid losing any work.
